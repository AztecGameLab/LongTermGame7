  message: 'The entrypoint is a scene that is always loaded first, before all other
    scenes. This will happen automatically in the editor, but not in the final build.
    Hence, we need the entrypoint scene to always be #1 in the build settings.


    Occassionally,
    you may have to edit the entrypoint when changing project-wide settings and systems.'
