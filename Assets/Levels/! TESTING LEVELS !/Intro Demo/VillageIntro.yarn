Villager: One of my friends stumbled across the most peculiar rock the other day. He took one look at it and burst into a murderous rage. 
Villager: I'm going out to the forest to see it for myself...

Villager: Have you seen a red Ventling on your travels? I used to feed her in my garden several times a day. 
Villager: She hasn't been around for several days now, and I fear something terrible has happened!

Villager: You would be wise to listen to the Chieftain. He is knowledgable of all things in the forest.
Villager: Just the other day, he saved my entire cauliflower crop by dusting it with some restorative powder.
Villager: He claims that his knowledge is borrowed from the wise ones, but I think he's just being humble.

Chieftain: ... and before you go, I have word from a gatherer who arrived here not long ago.
Chieftain: He says he heard the sounds of a struggle and a voice in the distance. When he arrived at what he thought was the source of the noise, he found nothing but blood and boot prints.
// todo: ... bubble
Chieftain: I advise you to be cautious when navigating the forest. The world is changing, and outsiders grow more daring as the days pass. Good day.
(It's about time for you to head home, after a hard day's work.)
(That last part however...)

It's an Artichokie, laying face down on the ground. It's skin appears battered and discolored.
(An Artichokie? What is it doing so far from the forest?)
(It appears to be breathing, at least.)
The Artichokie is now face up. It has an exhausted expression on its face.
Artichokie: Please... save them... they... took...
The Artichokie closes it's eyes. It has lost consciousness.
(Too exhausted, even to speak. I'll take it inside to rest.)

Chieftain: Back so soon? Did you forget something?
<<music-play silence>>
Chieftain: A hurt Artichokie? And it told you to save... someone?
// todo: gesture / ... bubble
Chieftain: Resting inside your house, at the moment? At least it's still alive...
Chieftain: Thank you for letting me know. I must speak to the wise ones to discern the dignificance of this event... Please look after this Artichokie until it recovers. 
Chieftain: Now, if you'll excuse me...

Artichokie: Hey, hey! You're back! I thought you weren't gonna help me.
Artichokie: Anyway, let's go! Come on!
// todo: surprise or confusion bubble
Artichokie: Huh? What? You don't know what's been going on?!?
<<music-stop village>>
Artichokie: We've been getting abducted left and right, since a few days ago.
// todo: artichokie ... bubble
Artichokie: My family is gone... I have no idea where they took them.
// todo: artichokie ... bubble
(Monster abduction? And who would do this? Why?)
// todo: player ... bubble
(You inquire about the "weird flesh", but the Artichokie is too agitated to notice.)
Artichokie: Then they poked me with something... and I've felt sick since.
Artichokie: And then they took the other monsters there, and told me to stay put...
Artichokie: ... but I'm not doing that! I'm going to save them! And you're coming with me!
<<music-play village>>
(It's hard to argue with that. After all, its your job to protect the forest and monsters alike.)
(You should return to the Chieftain and notify him of your imminent journey.)

// todo: play tree fall sfx, screen shake
Crash! The sound of a tree falling in the distance echoes throughout the forest.
Artichokie: Wh-what was that?! It sounded big...
Artichokie: What if it's that weird human again? We should go now!!
(The Chieftain will have to wait.)
(That sound seemed to originate from the north-east. I should head deeper into the forest and investigate further.)
