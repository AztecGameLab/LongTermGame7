# Welcome to LTG7!

## How to contribute
1) Join the [Aztec Game Lab discord](https://discord.com/invite/3EqzCWUGjZ), come to one of our meetings and say hi! An admin will add you to this repository.
2) Download and install the following tools: 
   - [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (If you are unsure, use GitHub Desktop!)
   - [Unity 2020.3.41f](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2020.3.41)
   - _(programming only)_ [JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/#section=windows), [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/), or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
     - Note: Rider is **strongly** recommended for all programmers, but is only free with the [GitHub Education pack](https://docs.github.com/en/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-students/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-student) (which is free and easy to sign up for)
   - _(audio only)_ [FMOD Studio 2.02.07](https://www.fmod.com/download/#fmodstudio) (You need to make an account to view the downloads here, which is annoying)
3) Clone this GitHub project to your work computer. (todo: video here as well)
4) Create a new branch for your work, and make some cool changes to the project. (todo: video here as well)
5) Once you're happy with the changes, create a pull request. One of the admins will take a look, and then accept the changes into the main branch. (todo: video here as well)
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5, until the game is done!

## Design Documents

todo @admins: use this section to consolidate all of the important documents for each team, as a sort of central hub, make sure the sharable links are view-only.

I added some of the documents that I made, but I wanted to let everyone else add their own stuff so nothing private gets leaked.
