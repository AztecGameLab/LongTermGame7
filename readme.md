# Welcome to LTG7!

## How to contribute
1) Join the [Aztec Game Lab discord](discord.gg/3EqzCWUGjZ), come to one of our meetings and say hi! An admin will add you to this repository.
2) Download and install the following tools: 
   - GitHub Desktop or Git (TODO: need link)
   - Unity 2020.3.41f (TODO: need link)
   - _(programming only)_ JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, or Visual Studio Code. (TODO: need link)
     - Note: Rider is **strongly** recommended for all programmers, but is only free with the GitHub Education pack (which is free and easy to sign up for) TODO: make video showing how to sign up
   - _(audio only)_ FMOD Studio (TODO: need link)
3) Clone this GitHub project to your work computer. (todo: video here as well)
4) Create a new branch for your work, and make some cool changes to the project. (todo: video here as well)
5) Once you're happy with the changes, create a pull request. One of the admins will take a look, and then accept the changes into the main branch. (todo: video here as well)
6) Repeat steps 4 and 5, until the game is done!

todo: if we start making task board, probably fit that into one of the steps

## Schedule
todo: make this more final

**winter break**: figuring out the groundwork for systems, prototyping mechanics to find out what is interesting, creating initial
schedule and task list as a starting point for full development, finding a good starting point for story, art, audio,
to move in so we can start strong.

(maybe aly you wanna put in spring semester dates from the calander here? probably worth linking too)
